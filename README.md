# FastMRI-Challenge
• The aim is the use of DL methods to make\textbf{ MRI scan} faster.
  By producing accurate images from under-sampled data. 
  
• Developing a Hybrid GAN to reconstruct MR image from \textbf{4X and 8X Under Sampled K-Space data from a single-coil and multi-coil       MRI}. The GAN uses self attention module with dual discriminators to maintain structural integrity during reconstruction and lots of       small functionalities to improve reconstruction.| More ongoing experiments and ideas.

• Experimenting with a new dehazing architechure for noise removal.
